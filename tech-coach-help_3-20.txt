I can't figure out how to iterate over the objects in an array that is created dynamically. I want to return each item as a separate HTML element. My 2nd for loop seems to not even be running and I can't figure out what is going on. This is the function I am wrestling with:

```function displayDictionaryResults(dictionaryArr) {
  console.log(dictionaryArr);
  // grab all matching dictionary entries
  console.log(`this is array length: ${dictionaryArr.length}`);

  let defArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < dictionaryArr.length; i++) {
    defArr.push(`${dictionaryArr[i].shortdef.join("; ")}`);
  }
  console.log(`this is defArr: `, defArr);

  for (i = 0; i < defArr.length; i++) {
    return defArr.pop();
  }  
}```

dictionaryArr.forEach((dictObj) => {
     console.log(dictObj.shortdef)  //This will give the shortDef values
     $('someUlElement').append(`
         <li><p>Definition(s):</p>
      `) 
     dictObj.def.forEach((defArrObj, index) => {
       //you'll probably need to use the jquery `.append` method. You cannot return anything from a for loop
       $('someLiElement').append(`           
               <p>${index} ${defArrObj}</p>
        `)
    })
})

I know it needs refining, but at this point I am just trying to figure out how to access the array items I need to display.

what I have tried:
Array.pop()
running forEach() on `defArr`
storing 2nd for loop function in a variable
console.log `defArr` after the for loop and outside the function block
